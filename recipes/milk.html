    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mmmmm...miiiiilk.</p>
    <br><h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cow</li>
        <li>Bucket (optional)</li>
        <li>Gloves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br><h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a cow. Brace yourself, for this will be the easiest step.</li>
        <li>Sedate and/or seduce the cow to instill a sense of calm.</li>
        <li>Put on the gloves if you have them. If not, well, then don't.</li>
        <li>Firmly grasp the utters and YANK as hard as you can. If white comes out,
            you have done it successfully and created milk. If red comes out, then you
            yanked TOO HARD and sorry to tell ya, but that's blood. Ouch. If an off-white comes out, those
            aren't the utters... Run away as fast as you can!!
        </li>
        <li>Collect whatever liquid came out with the bucket, or just hydrate straight from the source.</li>
        <li>If you were succesful, enjoy! If not, attend therapy.</li>

    </ol>
